-tests naming convention:
    - FoodTests instead of TestFoodClass
-java doc @author needs to be directly above class (thus,under imports/packages)



    /**
     *  for createSuitableHamper(nutritionalRequirements: NutritionalItems) method in Family Class
     *  my suggestion: since family class and hamper class is composition relationship,
     *  what if we just create and calculate best hamper within the Family class constructor
     *  because it just seems like duplicated method calcBestHamper() in Hamper Class
     *
     *
     *  public Family(AM:int, AF:int, CO8:int, CU8:int) {
     *      this.AM = AM;
     *      this.AF = AF;
     *      this.C08 = C08;
     *      this.CU8 = CU8;
     *
     *      calcIndividualWeeklyNutritionalNeeds()  // in here this.IndividualWeeklyNutritionalNeeds will set
     *
     *      this.hamper = new Hamper(this.IndividualWeeklyNutritionalNeeds)
     *
     *  }
     *
     *  public Hamper(nutritionalRequirements: NutritionalItems){
     *      ...
     *      calcBestHamper()
     *      ...
     *  }
     *
